## The Lending Club

A prediction model is build to determine if a loan is repaid or not based on a set of features (11 variables).

<ul>
  <li><b>LoanData_train.csv</b> : training dataset used to build the model.</li>
  <li><b>LoanData_test.csv</b> : testing dataset used for evaluating the model.</li>
</ul>
    
 The dataset can be downloded from https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action. Although, in this project 10,000 observations simplified to 11 variables is considered.
